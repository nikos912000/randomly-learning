- Complex systems are all around us, either as technical solutions or as connections between humans.

- Complex is something that consists of many parts. Something complex may or may not be difficult or easy to understand. Google's server infrastructure, show a high degree of complexity, but may not necessarily be complicated. (see [Quora](https://qr.ae/psSk1t)).
- Complicated is something that is hard to analyse or understand. It may or may not be made up of many parts (see [Quora](https://qr.ae/psSk1t)).
- A chaotic system is one of the unknown unknowns, meaning you can never be sure if your knowledge, experience, and analysis will be beneficial or applicable to a future event due to the nature of continuous change. The only way to actually work with a chaotic system is to react as outcomes take place. 
- ‘Complex’ is the opposite of ‘simple’; ‘complicated’ is more like the opposite of ‘easy’.

- As knowledge increases, there is a "clockwise drift" from chaotic through complex and complicated to simple.

- Rick Nason, an associate professor of finance at Dalhousie University’s Rowe School of Business, ably explains in his new book, [It’s Not Complicated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32660815-it-s-not-complicated), if you manage complex things as if they are merely complicated, you’re likely to be setting your company up for failure.

```
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
